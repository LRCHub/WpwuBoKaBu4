Disconnected!
I gotta be glam, I gotta be fun
Don't you know that I'm
disconnected!
You think I'm the one my baby
Can't you see I'm not that kind?
Dancin' time
A crazy spot of light all over
your body
Move in time
You gotta feel the rhythm
pump in your blood
You don't hear me callin'
Spinnin' like a rollin'
Top and crazy goin' around
Up and down in a dream
Beamin' out forever
Turnin' in the music machine
I gotta be glam, I gotta be fun
Don't you know that I'm
disconnected!
You think I'm the one my baby
Can't you see I'm not that kind?
I don't wanna shine,
don't wanna be fine
Can you hear me shout,
disconnected!
You make up your mind, my baby
Tell me are you gonna stay?
Reach for me
I never said that I was
gonna be easy
Run from me
I might be havin' fun just
watchin' you dance
You don't hear me callin'
Spinnin' like a rollin'
Top and crazy goin' around
Up and down in a dream
Beamin' out forever
Turnin' in the music machine
I gotta be glam, I gotta be fun
Don't you know that I'm
disconnected!
You think I'm the one my baby
Can't you see I'm not that kind?
I don't wanna shine,
don't wanna be fine
Can you hear me shout,
disconnected!
You make up your mind, my baby
Tell me are you gonna stay?
Dancin' time
