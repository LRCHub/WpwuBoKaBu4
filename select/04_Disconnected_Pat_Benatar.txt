The hammer lands
The verdict stand
The walls come tumbllin down
The color code
Rule of thimb
Shadows on the sun

Can you tell me?
Where it's really at

All around the world tonight
People watchin
People waitin
All around the world tonight
People feelin
Disconnected
(Somebody better plug me in)

The jukebox plays
A toxic waltz
A factory belches steam
A sidewalk end in baby steps
The widow maker screams
(And it sounds like this)
Hear her call your name

All around the world tonight
People watchin
People waitin
All around the world tonight
People feelin
Disconnected
(Somebody better plug me in)

The page is turned
The city burned
The whole world falls apart
The plug is pulled
Truth escapes
The space between our hearts
Space between our hearts
Space between our hearts

All around the world tonight
