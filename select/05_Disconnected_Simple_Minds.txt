Sometime i can see the world
By staring through your dark and misty eyes
I dont want to hear the words
Or anything you know you cant deny
Everytime i feel myself rejected
Disconnected, from everything thats real
Everybody needs to feel respected
Not disconnected
Only in my dreams i feel protected
This is reflected in all that I believe
Everybody needs to feel respected
Not disconnected

I dont want to hear the sound
Of your wide world when it comes crashing down

I can only help you if you're sure
You want to keep me hangin' round
I will only hear the sound
Of your wide world when it comes crashing down

I can only help you
If you're sure you want to keep me hangin' round

Only in my dreams i feel protected
This is reflected in all that I believe
Everybody needs to feel respected
Not disconnected
Everytime i feel myself rejected
Disconnected, from everythings that real
Everybody needs to feel respected
Not disconnected
Only in my dreams i feel protected
This is reflected in all that I believe
Everybody needs to feel respected
Not disconnected
Everytime i feel myself rejected
Disconnected, from everythings that real
Everybody needs to feel respected
Not disconnected
